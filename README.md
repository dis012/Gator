## ðŸ”§ Installing the `gator` CLI

To install the CLI tool locally, run:

```bash

This will install the binary as gator in your $GOPATH/bin directory. Make sure that directory is in your PATH:
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

Now you can run gator from anywhere!

## Configuration

Create a configuration file named .gator_config.json in your home directory:
```bash
~/.gator_config.json
```

Example config:

```bash
{
  "db_url": "postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/yourdbname?sslmode=disable",
  "current_user_name": "alice"
}
```

db_url: Your PostgreSQL connection string.
current_user_name: The default user you want to use for logged-in commands.

## Running the program

After installing and setting up your config, just run:
```bash
